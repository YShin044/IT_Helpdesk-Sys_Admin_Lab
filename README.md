A hands-on lab environment simulating the IT infrastructure of **MinhTam Company**, a small-to-medium enterprise. This project demonstrates practical skills in system administration, security hardening, and process automation to solve real-world business challenges.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project was designed to move beyond theory and apply system administration principles in a practical setting. The core of the lab is a fully functional Active Directory environment where various policies and automation scripts have been deployed to enhance security, standardize user environments, and improve administrative efficiency.

> **Core Mission:** To build and administer a scalable Active Directory infrastructure for **MinhTam Company**, solving practical challenges related to security, productivity, and IT operations.

### Key Capabilities Demonstrated:
-   **Systematic Design:** Logical and scalable Active Directory architecture.
-   **Problem Solving:** Effective use of Group Policy (GPO) to enforce business rules.
-   **Automation Mindset:** Leveraging PowerShell to eliminate manual, repetitive tasks.
-   **Technical Documentation:** Clear and professional documentation of processes and solutions.

## 🚀 Implemented Solutions

### 1. Foundational Design: Active Directory Structure
The default AD structure was replaced with a custom, multi-tiered Organizational Unit (OU) design. This logical hierarchy is optimized for granular permission delegation and targeted GPO application, reflecting best practices for enterprise environments.

### 2. Centralized Management: Policy Enforcement via GPO
Group Policy was leveraged as the primary tool to enforce security standards and deploy configurations across the organization.

| Icon | GPO Name | Business Objective | Detailed Documentation |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🛡️ | **Corp - Security Policy** | Enforced a strong password policy & an automatic screen lock to secure endpoints. | [View Docs](./GPO-01-Security-Policy/GPO-01-Security-Policy.md) |
| ⛔ | **Corp - Block USB Devices** | Mitigated data leakage and malware risks by disabling removable storage devices. | [View Docs](./GPO-02-Block-USB/GPO-02-Block-USB.md) |
| 📦 | **Corp - Deploy Python-3.4.3** | Automated the deployment of essential software (Python) to all workstations. | [View Docs](./GPO-03-Deploy-Software/GPO-03-Deploy-Software.md) |
| 🔗 | **KinhDoanh - Map Drive S** | Provided seamless access to departmental data by auto-mapping a network drive. | [View Docs](./GPO-04-Map-Network-Drive/GPO-04-Map-Network-Drive.md) |
| 🌐 | **Corp - Set Default Language** | Chuẩn hóa ngôn ngữ nhập liệu mặc định (US English). | [View Docs](./GPO-05-Set-Default-Language/GPO-05-Set-Default-Language.md) |

### 3. Efficiency & Automation: The Power of PowerShell
Scripts were developed to solve time-consuming and error-prone administrative tasks.

*   **Scenario 1: New Employee On-boarding (`Create-NewUsers.ps1`)**
    > **Problem:** Manually creating user accounts is time-consuming and leads to inconsistent naming conventions and permissions.
    > **Solution:** A robust PowerShell script that reads from a CSV file to bulk-create standardized user accounts, featuring built-in conflict detection to prevent duplicates.
    >

*   **Scenario 2: Security Auditing (`Find-InactiveUsers.ps1`)**
    > **Problem:** Stale, unused accounts ("ghost accounts") are a significant and often overlooked security liability.
    > **Solution:** An automated script that scans the entire domain for accounts inactive for over 90 days and exports a detailed CSV report for administrative review and action.
